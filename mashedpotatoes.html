      <p>Mashed potatoes are a delicious food that should be eaten with ketchup. They are just potatoes so why can't you put ketchup on them? We put ketchup on french fries. I'm sick of the ketchup-potato double standard ketchup is really good on mashed potatoes</p>
      <h3>yum</h3>

      <p>Since these ketchup fries look so good we should put the ketchup on the mashed potatoes too</p>
